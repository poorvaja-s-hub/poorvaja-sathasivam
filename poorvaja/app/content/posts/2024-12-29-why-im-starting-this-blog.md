Let's be honest—starting a blog feels a little intimidating. There's this voice in my head saying, *"Does the world really need another tech blog?"* But here's the thing: this isn't just about adding to the noise. For me, this blog is about learning, growing, and sharing the journey as it unfolds.

Over the years, I've worked on some fascinating projects—like using **machine learning** to analyze medical imaging and experimenting with **AI** technologies like **LLMs**. These experiences taught me a lot, but they also left me with so many questions and ideas. Writing feels like the perfect way to sort through them and maybe even inspire someone else along the way.

Tech is exciting, but let's be real—it's not always smooth sailing. There are bugs that make you want to pull your hair out, tools that feel impossible to learn, and those magical moments when everything finally clicks. I want this blog to be a space where I can share all of it—the challenges, the successes, and the lessons in between.

I've been meaning to do this for a while, but I always found reasons to put it off. Too busy, too nervous, too unsure of what to say. But I've realized that there's never a "perfect" time to start. So here I am, diving in and figuring it out as I go.

This blog is as much for you as it is for me. Whether you're here to learn something new, connect with someone who's on a similar journey, or just curious about what's next in tech, I'm glad you're here. Let's explore, experiment, and grow together—I can't wait to see where this takes us.
